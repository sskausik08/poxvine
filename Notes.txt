==================================================
Done : 
1. Dumping flows of a switch on mininet: sh ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1
2. msg.match.dl_type = ethernet.IP_TYPE : Needed to set to check IP.
3. Use VLAN ID as tenant ID + RouteTags -> Needs to be added at first switch of route and stripped at last switch of route.
4. To send packet back input port, needed to use OFFP_IN_PORT

Not Able to add tunnels, try out an alternate approach.
5. Cannot use DST MAC address as tunnel destination, (before host needs to be modified.) So, using source MAC address as tunnel.



13 Feb : 
1. NSX reproduces in software the entire networking environment, including L2, L3 and L4–L7 network services within each virtual network. NSX offers a distributed logical architecture for L2–L7 services, provisioning them programmatically when virtual machines are deployed and moving them with the virtual machines,

2. The VND paper does not use virtual routers for its abstraction. Since it is more of a trace collection program, it does not 
require the need of instantiation of a virtual router/switch.

----
Building a network Testing tool?

->For conventional networks : 
Trouble points are routers (switches do not induce issues in the network) due to configuration, etc. 
So, we can consider L3 topologies. 

->For SDN networks : 
SDNs do not have different switches and routers (can be performed by a common entity). 
We can deploy virtual switches on the physical hardware and have a controller for the OVS. This way, we can 
test multiple SDNs as well.

----Notes
Plan of Action:
1. Physical topology creation - Done.
2. Virtual Network Specification.
3. Mapping to Physical Network.
4. Controller program to install rules for correct forwarding. 
	--> First Step : Simple connectivity between entities. In this, I will treat vRouters as hosts for simplicity.




Todo:
1. ARP Packet Handling! 
2.
