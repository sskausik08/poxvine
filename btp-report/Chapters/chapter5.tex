\chapter{Implementation}
In this chapter, we describe POXVine's implementation in detail. 

\section{MinSwitchMapper}
The POXVine System can use any host mapper heuristic to map the virtual hosts. For \emph{modularization}, each host mapper takes input the physical Topology and virtual Topology object and stores the mapping in text files for other modules of the system to use. This also allows us to use different host mappers simultaneously for different tenants. \\

MinSwitchMapper minimises the diameter of the network graph connecting the hosts of the virtual topology as seen in Chapter 5. Algorithm 1 is used to find the virtual-to-physical mapping which minimises the diameter. The intuition behind the algorithm is that the switches connected to hosts initially carry the capacity of the host. Every round, we \emph{percolate} the capacity to its neighbours, so, the first round we get a switch with capacity exceeding the required capacity, we can terminate the algorithm. A host list obtained in a \emph{later round} will have greater distance among hosts as we percolate to farther hosts each round, increasing the distance, and thus the diameter of the network graph formed by the virtual hosts. \\

Once the algorithm provides a list of physical hosts with sufficient capacity, we try to map the largest virtual host on the largest physical host, and if we can, repeat the step again till all the virtual hosts are mapped. If such a mapping is not possible, then we reiterate Algorithm 1 to find a different host list to map the virtual hosts.

\section{NetworkMapping}
The NetworkMapping class uses the \emph{virtual-to-physical} mappings provided by the host mapper, and calculates all the network routes on the physical topology required for the virtual hosts to talk to each other. Consider the topology in Figure 4.3. The NetworkMapping object will first find the route from $v1$ to $v2$ in the virtual topology, that is $v1 \rightarrow vs1 \rightarrow vs2 \rightarrow v2$.  \\

The Physical Topology object has a method \verb|getCompleteRoute()| which translates the virtual route to the corresponding physical topology route by finding the physical route for each hop in the virtual topology. Thus, from the virtual route, we obtain the following physical route : $v1 \rightarrow s1 \rightarrow s2 \rightarrow s3  \rightarrow vs1 \rightarrow s3 \rightarrow s2  \rightarrow s1 \rightarrow vs2 \rightarrow s1  \rightarrow s2 \rightarrow s3 \rightarrow v2$. \\
\begin{center}
	Pseudo Code for Network Route Generation
\end{center}
\begin{lstlisting}
for each pair of virtual hosts{h1, h2}) : 
  virtualRoute = virtualTopology.getRoute(h1, h2)
  physicalRoute = 
    physicalTopology.getCompleteRoute(virtualRoute)
  physicalRoute.setRouteTags()
  add physicalRoute to networkPaths
end for
\end{lstlisting}
Note that we need to add rules from $v1$ to $v2$ and the other way as well, $v2$ to $v1$. After generating all the routes for a virtual topology, this is passed to the NetworkMapper module, which translates them into OpenFlow rules to install at the respective switches. 

\section{NetworkMapper}
The NetworkMapper is a POX application. Using the NetworkMapping object, it obtains all the routes it needs to install OpenFlow rules for at the mininet switches. As discussed in the previous chapter, we need \emph{Route Tags} to distinguish between different segments in the network route. The Route class has a function \verb|SetRouteTags()| which differentiates the segments and marks those switches in the route where there is a need to match and increment the route tags (start and end of segments).
